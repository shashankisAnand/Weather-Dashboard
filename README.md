Weather Analytics & Forecast Dashboard 🌦️
📖 Project Overview
This project features a comprehensive Weather Analysis Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI. It provides a real-time and historical overview of climatic conditions for specific regions (currently focused on Ranchi, Pune, and Udaipur).

The report is designed with a modern, dark-themed UI (Glassmorphism style) to track critical environmental metrics such as temperature, air quality (AQI), humidity, and precipitation, assisting users in making data-driven decisions regarding outdoor activities or environmental monitoring.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
Visualization Tool: Microsoft Power BI (Desktop & Service)

Data Transformation: Power Query Editor (ETL)

Calculations: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

UI/UX Design: Figma (for creating the custom background canvas and layout)

Data Sources: (Mention your source here, e.g., OpenWeatherMap API, Kaggle Dataset, or Simulated JSON data)

📊 Key Features
Dynamic Location Switching: Ability to toggle between different cities (Pune, Ranchi, Udaipur) to view localized data.

Air Quality Monitoring: Detailed breakdown of pollutants including PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, CO, and PM2.5.

Forecast Trends: Line chart visualization for weekly temperature forecasting.

Real-time Metrics:

Sunrise & Sunset times.

UV Index & Visibility ranges.

Wind Speed & Direction.

Atmospheric Pressure & Humidity %.

Conditional Formatting: Visual indicators (Green/Orange/Red) for Air Quality levels (e.g., "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups").
